# Machine Learning Project

In this assignment, your task is to implement a Multilayer Perceptron Neural Network and evaluate its
performance in classifying handwritten digits. After completing this assignment, you should be able to
understand:
 How Neural Network works and use Feed Forward, Back Propagation to implement Neural Network?.
 How to setup a Machine Learning experiment on real data?.
 How regularization plays a role in the bias-variance tradeo?.
